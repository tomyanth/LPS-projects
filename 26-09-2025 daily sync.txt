AA limitation 
infra team need to add more suggestion and solution to the target that the email suggest (11:03 email)
need samson, savian and todd endorsement (suggested by Anthony Yick)

Can we mentioned AA architecture? But we actually we don't have any info except mirror IP and IP range cannot exceed /24
Databricks does not know AA need IP is splitted into 2 subnets, IP need to mirror (2 identical IP in the 2 subnets)
We can add facts in the email, but cannot include things that we deduce (without fact check)


we need to know how databricks think, instead of asking them to choose an option for us. So no need to limit to those 3 options.

we may need to set an environment to test out the 3 solutions, but we do not have env
we need to remove irrelevant content from the checklist or uncheck items and jot down why those items are irrelevant.


test plan we need to list the template.


databricks > 2 test form > testman email (priority suggest by Anthony Yick)

testplan need 1,2 example for each test cases so the client understand what's going on.

at least we need to prep one case for the client and the reverse proxy case should be the easiest to set up. 
we need to get budget for the test case experiment now or in the future.


in short we need to get some small real show case to persuade the client.

can do a small experiment with PC, to see if there is IP change.
